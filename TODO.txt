TO DO:
class Chap
 - position
 - velocity
 - bool (on board)
 - color (could be an int value, denotes team)

 move method in chap.java <32-36>

 methods setPos, findStop, killChap

 main loop: (main.java)
- takes user's input
  inner loop: solves for board motion until all chaps stop
      - runs NextEvent(): takes in current board layout
        - solves for time to next event and event type
        - event type ("stop" or "collide")
      - animate chap motion until this time
      - if eventType is stop:
        - sets velocity of that chap to 0.
        - checks if it flew off the board
      - if eventType is collide:
        - executes Collide(c1, c2) to solve for new velocities of chaps
      - repeats loop until next event is never because all chaps stopped.
 - after all chaps stop play the full animation
 - decides which user inputs or if any user has won the game

 method NextEvent:
  - finds the time to the soonest event.
  - selects smallest time of all stop times
